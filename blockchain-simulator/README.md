# Blockchain Simulator

This project is a simple blockchain simulator.
It tries to cover the basics of what a blockchain does behind the scenes using OOP principles.

It has several missing features (like transaction signing) since it tries not to dive into technicalities too much.
User inputs are not fully sanitized, just some simple checks are performed.
Large numbers might break the program.

It somewhat follows the model of Ethereum (in terms of funds handling)

The menu was tested in Windows Command Prompt

Note: Inside the menu, the slow printing can be skipped by pressing enter. The exe can also be ran with --fast parameter.
